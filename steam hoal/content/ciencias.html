<h1>How math took over F1</h1>
<p1>

  <p>Firstable the numbers are always changing. F1's telemetry system continuously collects data on all sorts of variables in racing cars: oil and water levels, clutch fluid pressure, G-forces and engine revolutions per minute. This information is communicated  to engineers in  pits and in control centers using a variety of radio and wireless technologies.
  </p>
  <p>Aside from this external data from the car such as temperature, air pressure and humidity. The numbers collected on both vehicle and climate from the obvious parts of a large equation, the sum of which will indicate which lap the rider is on in the pit and what adjustments will be made to the car.  </p>
  <p>F1 is the most data-intensive sport in the world, and math influences race and championship results more strongly than other sports. As a result, developers of new technologies will bet very high to make the process of  data mining and calculating the required sums more complex and efficient. </p>

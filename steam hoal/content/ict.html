<h1>How ICT took over F1</h1>
<p1>

  <p>But that has changed in recent years. Ever since things like fully hybrid powertrains were introduced, the technology used in F1 has become increasingly relevant to road cars.
    
  </p>
  <p>Over the years, fans have also watched Formula 1's use of new technologies. Recently, hybrid power units have become a game changer for F1. Before hybrid electric units were introduced in Formula 1 cars in 2014, The average thermal efficiency of cars on the road was around 30%. This means that only a third of the car's gasoline is used to power it.</p>
  
  <h2>High speed of F1 wireless technology:</h2>
  
  <p> In 2017, F1 teams started using a system of two wireless technologies: multigigabit Wi-Fi and 5 GHz. This technology allows an F1 car to transmit data wirelessly as it moves through a tunnel lane. When the car is 4 meters close to the pitlane it starts transferring data much faster, with download speeds of up to 1.9 GB per second. This means that a gigabyte of data takes less than five seconds to transfer. </p>

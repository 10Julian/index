<h1>Chemistry took over F1</h1>

  <p>All the components must survive the 90 minutes and have to make the car as fast as possible, for making the body of the car the lightest to make the car the fastest the use the carbon fiber, which with its strength and low weight properties, it has became one of the essential materials for building an F1 car, There are areas of F1 where chemistry is important - fuels and lubricants being the most obvious. In more mechanical areas there isn't much room for chemistry, given the regulations are actually very tight about materials used in the car itself.

  <h2>Gasoline</h2>
    <img src="../imagenes/23.PNG" alt="Smiley face" height="79" style="float:left;width:220px;height:140px;">
  <p>Gasoline is a liquid hydrocarbon that has an approximate density of 850 kg/m3 and is fundamentally composed of 75% saturated hydrocarbons or paraffins, and 25% aromatic hydrocarbons. The most common chemical formula is C12H26 (12 carbon atoms to 26 hydrogen).    </p>
  <p>In Formula 1, the fuel does not contain the chemical additives responsible for adapting to daily use that are required of conventional gasoline.</p>
  <p> Although it has 99% of the properties of conventional gasoline, in that remaining 1% is the main responsible for the explosion, for the chemical reaction that generates almost 19,000 revolutions per minute, a figure that a conventional propellant is unable to withstand.</p>
  <p> Being a denser fuel, until today, the F1 technical regulations insist that the fuel not be stored in the garage at less than 10Â°C below ambient temperature, published by race control one hour before each session, and the rules also prohibit teams from installing coolers in the car. </p>

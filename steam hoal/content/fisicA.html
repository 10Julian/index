<h1>How physics took over F1</h1>

  <p>F1 cars are designed to utilize basic principles of aerodynamics to their advantage, controlling how the air flows around the car to make it faster and minimizing the drag, for example when the drs is charged and turned on, the wing opens in the middle for the air flow to go through it, to gain more speed, the F1 drivers need to have a basic understanding of physics.

  <h2>Newton law    </h2>
    <img src="../imagenes/Captura.PNG" alt="Smiley face" height="79" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
  <p>Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or at MRU unless an external force acts on it.</p>
  <p>Newton's second law tells us to quantify the concept of force. Acceleration acquired by a body is proportional to the force applied to it.
  This law shows us that in F1, as the mass is constant, the more force the engine generates, the more acceleration the car generates. In addition, the mass is never constant due to aerodynamic load. </p>
  <p>Newton's third law tells us that all forces act in pairs of two in opposite directions, there are no isolated forces.
    In F1, when the engine creates movement in the wheels they exert force against the ground, generating a counterforce on the tarmac that causes the wheels to move forward.    </p>
